Title:	Don't worry, be happy

## Telegram keeps customers by making them happy ##

Telegram is about making you happy and about making your client's happy.

### Happy means:

* Focus on what you're good at: design and use the tools you love best
* Putting you and your clients in control
* Let your clients manage their own content using email or in a shared
  Dropbox folder
* Host on Telegram knowing you've got a rock solid, super-scalable system that
  will serve your client's content 24x7
* Use features like emailing PDFs of pages and other stuff to make life easier for your clients

### Avoid stones in your path:

* Telegram doesn't require any database so you don't have to configure MySQL or learn "yet another" technology (except maybe [GitHub](http://github.com), but you should be learning it anyway)
* Telegram doesn't require extra passwords to post or access files or content because
  you've got that all on your hard drive
* Telegram is set up and ready to go. It'll take no more than 5 minutes to have a site
  live between the time you sign and the time your first site is running. No special
  technology to learn… just what you already know.
