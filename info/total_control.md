title:	Total Control

## You have total and complete control over the content on your Telegram-powered site

Telegram will serve any content in any format you want, so if you've got a HTML editor
that spits out a complete site like [Sandvox](http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/),
Telegram will publish it.

Want to use jQuery, no problem. Want to use another JavaScript library, no problem.

Need to serve Flash, AVIs, or any other kind of content, Telegram will publish it.

You can also use Telegram's site weaving features to create menus, convert Markdown,
RTF, Pages, and Word documents into HTML, and ability to wrap consistent
templates around HTML fragments.

## It's your choice, you're in control

Telegram templates can be stored as part of your site repository. Telegram templates
can also be public Git repositories or private GitHub repos. Telegram
templates can be hosted in ways that make your life easier.

## Whatever App ##

Telegram will serve content from whatever application you use to create it.
If you love Dreamweaver, yay. If you're a Compozer fan, woo hoo. BB Edit,
no problemo. Create content how you like best. Control content using the
tools you know best. Telegram will serve it.

## Whatever device ##

You can edit Telegram content on your phone, iPad, computer, whatever. You don't need
special software or a special App to create and manage your Telegram site.
