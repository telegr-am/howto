Title:	Wicked Scalable

## Telegram is Scalable ##

Telegram is scalable because Telegram sites are static sites… that means that there's
almost no CPU used to move the bytes from disk to the Internet and there's
no database access to slow things down.

Telegram is hosted on the [Amazon](http://aws.amazon.com) cloud, so we can always
add more storage and bandwidth.

## Static is the new Dynamic ##

By taking advantage of advanced JavaScript and other features of your browser,
you'll experience super interactive web sites that feel like native applications, yet
they were served by "static" HTML. Your users will see an awesome, magical
web site (as long as your designers do magic), but you don't have to pay extra for
custom servers.

Static content have become the new dynamic content. That's because browsers
make a much better distributed computation network than concentrating all the
computing in the datacenter.

Telegram will deliver your site super-fast no matter the load and the other services your
site access (like Twitter, Google Calendar, etc.) will give your users an excellent experience.


## Built by David Pollak ##

[David Pollak](http://blog.goodstuff.im) founded Telegram. David also built [Lift](http://liftweb.net)
which powers [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com) and David helped Twitter with scalability
issues in 2008. David knows scalable and built Telegram to scale.

## You don't pay extra for Scalable ##

Telegram's utility pricing (pay for the bandwidth and storage you use) means that you don't
pay extra for a "fast" box and you don't need to upgrade your plan if you have a month or
two of high traffic because your site was mentioned on Hacker News or CNN or something.
Yes, for those months, you'll pay more because your site traffic is higher, but when your
site traffic drops to a lower level, you pay less.
